# OpenPassVault
The truly open source, free password manager.

### About
OpenPassVault is an open source password designed to be full of features, without any charges. You shouldn't have to pay to keep your accounts secure.

Furthermore, OpenPassVault can be deployed on your own servers if you want an added layer of security. If that isn't your type of thing, you can create an account on our servers, and we'll manage everything for you.

OpenPassVault is currently under development, and isn't yet available for use. Want it quicker? Help us develop it by contributing to one or more of our repos.
